Market Share
Daily aggregate exchange volume of the top 100 most popular cryptoexchange platforms is more than $8 bln. and it keeps growing constantly. 
SafeCrypt.io exchange will take 0.06% fee per transaction, which would be one the lowest fees on the cryptomarket. 
By providing the highest quality cryptoexchange service and effectively satisfying the market demand, 
SafeCrypt will achieve strong economic growth and increase its market share:

Pessimistic Prediction 
Market Share = 0.9% 
Daily Exchange Volume = 0.9% of 8bln = 72000000 ($72mln)
SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 72mln = 43200 (~$43 thousand daily)

Realistic Prediction
Market Share = 5% 
Daily Exchange Volume = 5% of 8bln = 400000000 ($400mln)
SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 400mln = 240000 ($240 thousand daily)

Optimistic Prediction
Market Share = 9.6% 
Daily Exchange Volume = 9.6% of 8bln = 768000000 ($768mln)
SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 768mln = 460800 (~$460 thousand daily)

It goes without saying that SafeCrypt.io will put all reasonable efforts into making the optimistic prediction become reality. 
9.6% of market share is achievable with sufficient funding and by focusing the available resources on the realization of the 
planned activities (as specified on p.23-24 of the Whitepaper).
